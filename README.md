- Click on the "Demo" link above to see the output
- I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I also used advanced sizing and spacing by using REM units to all of the elements, that way I can easily re-specify them on specific breakpoints. As I build this project, I learned how to watch out for bugs way quicker. I learned how to watch out for absolute units which cause the elements to get cluttered, I also realized that we should be specific when specifying class names to prevent bugs.
